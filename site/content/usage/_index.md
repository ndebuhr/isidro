## System configuration

### Slack configuration
_Relevant if you are using Slack as your chat tool_

Create a Slack app:
1. Update the [example Slack manifest](slack/manifest.yaml) to use your Isidro endpoint
1. Create a Slack app using the application manifest
1. Consider giving the app a profile picture (e.g., the Terminator)
1. Use the verification token, under the app's "Basic Information" for Helm value `slack.verificationToken`
1. Use the OAuth token, under the app's "OAuth & Permissions" for Helm value `slack.oauthToken`

### Mattermost configuration
_Relevant if you are using Mattermost as your chat tool_

1. In the System Console, under "Integrations > Bot Accounts", "Enable Bot Account Creation"
1. In the Integrations portal, create a bot account with the name "isidro" and role "System Administrator"
    1. Consider giving the app a profile picture (e.g., the Terminator)
1. Copy the access token to the Helm values (or Skaffold overrides) as `mattermost.accessToken`
1. Add an outgoing webhook:
    1. Recommended title is "Isidro Mentions"
    1. Recommended description is "Push notification enabling the Isidro chatbot to respond to @mentions"
    1. Application type is "application/json"
    1. Trigger word is "@isidro"
    1. Callback URL is https://api.example.com/v1/submit (replace api.example.com with your Isidro API domain)
    1. Leave the remaining values as the defaults
1. Copy the verification token to the Helm values (or Skaffold overrides) as `mattermost.verificationToken`
1. Upgrade the Helm installation

### GitHub Actions
_Relevant if you are triggering GitHub Actions workflows with the chatbot_

Create a personal access token, which includes `repo`, `workflow`, and `packages` permissions.  Use the token for the Helm value `deployer.github.token`.

## Usage

Mention @isidro in Slack messages, and get a response.  Use separate message threads for separate chatbot conversations.

### Test payload
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.example.com/v1/submit \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"token": "1234567890", "event": {"channel": "quality", "ts": "1234567890", "user": "me", "text": "Hello"}}'
```
